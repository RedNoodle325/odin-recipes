# odin-recipes

## Introduction
This project is focused on building a simple recipe website to practice and showcase basic HTML skills. The website will consist of a main index page with links to a few individual recipes. While the design of the site may remain basic, the goal is to reinforce knowledge of HTML structure, links, and page organization.

By the end of this project, the following skills will be demonstrated:
- Structuring a basic webpage using HTML.
- Creating a main index page linking to other pages.
- Using semantic HTML elements to organize content effectively.

This project is a great opportunity to solidify foundational web development concepts and prepare for more complex topics, like CSS and JavaScript, in future projects.

## Features
- Main index page with links to recipe pages.
- Semantic HTML elements for better structure.
- Basic linking between multiple pages.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- Git (for version control and project management)
