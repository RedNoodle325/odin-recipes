        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in an 8-inch nonstick pan over medium heat. Once butter is melted, crack eggs into the pan. Tilt pan to evenly distribute eggs. Cook until whites are no longer translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip eggs by pushing the pan away from you and slightly tossing eggs up and over. Move pan upwards to catch eggs.</li>
            <li>Cook on second side until desired doneness, 30 to 45 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
